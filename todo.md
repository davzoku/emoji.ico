# Todo

1. write a powershell/batch script to recursively add `+r` attribute to the subfolders

2. find an opensource icons repo to support programming languages ico with **transparent** background.

3. there are still a ton of 'rare' programming languages not supported. One alternative may be to use the alphabetic emoji as a stopgap solution.

4. maybe a way to simplify the whole process even more and more automation.

5. **and probably the most impt**; working examples on other OS like Mac and Linux
